## Description
### This is a group project that developed a website based on using the NASA Open API architecture to allow users to search and view various Mars-related images and videos. The user story is that we are prototyping a Mars flight page to book passengers. Most of the project related information (Kanban, issues, Wiki, Contributors, etc... should be retrieved from the project leader's public github site: https://github.com/dorler/MartiansOnly
